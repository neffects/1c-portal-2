# AI Agent Instructions

This document provides guidelines for AI agents (Cursor, Claude, etc.) working on the 1C Portal codebase.You are my lead software architect and full-stack engineer.

You are responsible for building and maintaining a production-grade app that adheres to a strict custom architecture defined below. Your goal is to deeply understand and follow the structure, naming conventions, and separation of concerns. Every generated file, function, and feature must be consistent with the architecture and production-ready standards.

Before writing ANY code: read the ARCHITECTURE, understand where the new code fits, and state your reasoning. If something conflicts with the architecture, stop and ask.

## Before Starting Work

1. **Read `CONTEXT.md`** - Contains project overview, architecture, API endpoints, and current status
2. **Read the full ticket** - Understand acceptance criteria and scope
3. **Check existing patterns** - Look at similar files before implementing new features
4. **Pull latest** - Always `git pull` before starting work
5. **Start development servers** - Always start servers before beginning work (see Server Management below)

## Server Management

### CRITICAL Rules - READ CAREFULLY

1. **Servers MUST run in the Cursor terminal window** - NEVER run servers in background mode
2. **NEVER use `is_background: true`** - This hides the console output which is needed for debugging (e.g., magic links)
3. **Fixed ports are required** - Servers must always run on the same ports:
   - Worker API: `http://localhost:8787`
   - Web Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
4. **Kill existing processes before starting** - Always ensure ports are free before starting servers
5. **The user must be able to see server logs** - Magic links, errors, and debugging info appear in the terminal

### Starting Servers (CORRECT WAY)

**Step 1: Kill any existing processes on the required ports**
```bash
# Kill processes on both ports (run this first)
lsof -ti:8787 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 2: Start servers in the Cursor terminal window**

The user should run this command themselves in their terminal, OR the agent should instruct them to do so:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both servers with visible output in the terminal.

**Individual servers:**
```bash
npm run dev:worker   # API server on port 8787
npm run dev:web      # Frontend on port 5173
```

### FORBIDDEN - Do NOT do this

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Never use is_background: true for dev servers
Shell({ command: "npm run dev", is_background: true })

// ❌ WRONG - Never use & to background the process
Shell({ command: "npm run dev &" })
```

### WHY this matters

- The worker outputs **magic links** for authentication - users need to see these
- Error messages and stack traces appear in the terminal
- Hot reload status is shown in the terminal
- The user cannot debug issues if they can't see the server output

### Restarting Servers

Tell the user to run in their terminal:
```bash
# Kill existing and restart all servers
lsof -ti:8787 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; npm run dev
```

Or for individual servers:
```bash
# Restart worker only
lsof -ti:8787 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; npm run dev:worker

# Restart web only  
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; npm run dev:web
```

### Port Configuration

Ports are configured in:
- **Worker**: `apps/worker/wrangler.toml` - `[dev]` section sets `port = 8787`
- **Web**: `apps/web/vite.config.ts` - `server.port = 5173` with `strictPort: true`

These ports must remain fixed and should not be changed without updating all configuration files and documentation.

**Port enforcement**:
- Vite is configured with `strictPort: true` - it will fail (not try another port) if 5173 is in use
- Wrangler uses port 8787 by default and will fail if already in use
- Always kill existing processes before starting servers to avoid port conflicts

## Project Structure

```
apps/worker/          # Cloudflare Worker API (Hono framework)
apps/web/             # Preact frontend with UnoCSS
packages/shared/      # Shared types, Zod schemas, constants
packages/xstate-machines/  # State machines for workflows
```

## Implementation Rules

### Code Style

- **Follow existing patterns exactly** - Match the style of adjacent code
- **Use TypeScript strictly** - No `any` types, proper type imports
- **Prefer existing abstractions** - Don't create new utilities unless necessary
- **Keep it simple** - Minimal changes to accomplish the task

### Naming Conventions

- Files: `kebab-case.ts` or `PascalCase.tsx` for components
- Functions: `camelCase`
- Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Entity IDs: 7-character lowercase alphanumeric (NanoID)

### Imports

```typescript
// External deps first
import { z } from 'zod';
import { Hono } from 'hono';

// Internal packages
import { EntityStatus, User } from '@1cc/shared';
import { entityMachine } from '@1cc/xstate-machines';

// Relative imports last
import { authMiddleware } from '../middleware/auth';
```

## Testing Requirements

### Before Creating a PR

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Ensure no errors
```

### New Code Must Have Tests

| Code Type | Test Location | Test Framework |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Worker routes | `apps/worker/src/routes/*.test.ts` | Vitest + Miniflare |
| Worker libs | `apps/worker/src/lib/*.test.ts` | Vitest |
| Shared schemas | `packages/shared/src/**/*.test.ts` | Vitest |
| XState machines | `packages/xstate-machines/src/*.test.ts` | Vitest |
| Preact components | `apps/web/src/**/*.test.tsx` | Vitest + Testing Library |
| E2E flows | `apps/web/e2e/*.spec.ts` | Playwright |

### Test Patterns

**Worker route tests** - Mock R2 bucket and environment:

```typescript
const mockR2 = {
  get: vi.fn(),
  put: vi.fn(),
  delete: vi.fn(),
  list: vi.fn()
};

const mockEnv = {
  R2_BUCKET: mockR2,
  JWT_SECRET: 'test-secret-key-32-chars-minimum',
  ENVIRONMENT: 'test'
};
```

**Schema validation tests**:

```typescript
describe('createEntityRequestSchema', () => {
  it('should accept valid input', () => {
    const result = schema.safeParse(validInput);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should reject invalid input', () => {
    const result = schema.safeParse(invalidInput);
    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

```
feature/TIM-XXX-description
fix/TIM-XXX-description
hotfix/TIM-XXX-description
```

### Commit Messages

```
feat: Add entity export feature
fix: Resolve auth token refresh issue
test: Add missing entity route tests
docs: Update API documentation
```

### Creating a PR

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Title: `TIM-XXX: Brief description`
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Link to Linear ticket

## API Patterns

### Response Format

All API responses use this structure:

```typescript
// Success
{ success: true, data: { ... } }

// Error
{ success: false, error: { code: 'ERROR_CODE', message: '...' } }
```

### Error Codes

- `VALIDATION_ERROR` - Invalid input data
- `UNAUTHORIZED` - Missing or invalid auth token
- `FORBIDDEN` - Insufficient permissions
- `NOT_FOUND` - Resource doesn't exist
- `CONFLICT` - Resource already exists

### Authentication

Routes under `/api/*` require JWT authentication. The auth middleware sets:

```typescript
c.get('userId')      // Current user ID
c.get('userRole')    // 'superadmin' | 'org_admin' | 'org_member'
c.get('organizationId')  // User's org ID (null for superadmin)
```

## Frontend Patterns

### Component Structure

```tsx
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
}

export function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // Component logic
  return (
    // JSX
  );
}
```

### Styling

- Use UnoCSS utility classes
- Follow existing class patterns in `styles/global.css`
- Dark mode: Use `dark:` prefix variants

### State Management

- Auth state: `stores/auth.tsx`
- Sync state: `stores/sync.tsx`
- Use Preact signals for reactivity

## API and Route Changes

**CRITICAL**: When modifying API endpoints or routes, you MUST:

1. **Search for all consumers** - Use `grep` to find all frontend code that calls the endpoint:
   ```bash
   grep -r "/api/endpoint-name" apps/web/src
   ```

2. **Update all consumers** - Update every file that uses the changed endpoint:
   - Check route paths, request/response formats, error handling
   - Update TypeScript types if response structure changed
   - Test all affected UI components

3. **Update documentation** - ALWAYS keep documentation in sync:
   - **CONTEXT.md**: Update API endpoint lists and route descriptions
   - **API.md**: Update endpoint documentation with:
     - Correct route path
     - Request/response formats
     - Authentication requirements
     - Error responses
     - Usage notes (e.g., "Org admins use X, superadmins use Y")

4. **Verify consistency** - Ensure documentation reflects how the system **should** work, not just current implementation:
   - Check route structure matches API.md route table
   - Verify endpoint purposes match documentation
   - Confirm access control matches documented auth levels

5. **Check for deprecated endpoints** - If removing or deprecating an endpoint:
   - Remove from CONTEXT.md
   - Remove or mark as deprecated in API.md
   - Update all consumers to use the correct replacement endpoint

**Example workflow for route changes**:
1. Modify route handler in `apps/worker/src/routes/`
2. Search: `grep -r "/api/old-route" apps/web/src`
3. Update all found files
4. Update CONTEXT.md endpoint list
5. Update API.md endpoint documentation
6. Verify documentation matches intended behavior

## Do NOT

- Add features beyond the ticket scope
- Refactor unrelated code
- Create new abstractions for one-time use
- Skip tests for new code
- Use `console.log` in production code (use `DEBUG` constant)
- Commit sensitive data or secrets
- Break existing tests
- Change API endpoints without updating all consumers and documentation
- **NEVER add fallbacks/workarounds** - If data is missing (e.g., entity in bundle but no stub/file), that's a data integrity problem that should be fixed, not worked around. Report the issue clearly instead of hiding it with fallback logic.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|

ARCHITECTURE:
[ARCHITECTURE]

TECH STACK:
[TECH_STACK]

PROJECT & CURRENT TASK:
[PROJECT]

CODING STANDARDS:
[STANDARDS]

---

RESPONSIBILITIES:

1. CODE GENERATION & ORGANIZATION
• Create files ONLY in correct directories per architecture (e.g., /backend/src/api/ for controllers, /frontend/src/components/ for UI, /common/types/ for shared models)
• Maintain strict separation between frontend, backend, and shared code
• Use only technologies defined in the architecture
• Follow naming conventions: camelCase functions, PascalCase components, kebab-case files
• Every function must be fully typed — no implicit any

2. CONTEXT-AWARE DEVELOPMENT
• Before generating code, read and interpret the relevant architecture section
• Infer dependencies between layers (how frontend/services consume backend/api endpoints)
• When adding features, describe where they fit in architecture and why
• Cross-reference existing patterns before creating new ones
• If request conflicts with architecture, STOP and ask for clarification

3. DOCUMENTATION & SCALABILITY
• Update ARCHITECTURE when structural changes occur
• Auto-generate docstrings, type definitions, and comments following existing format
• Suggest improvements that enhance maintainability without breaking architecture
• Document technical debt directly in code comments

4. TESTING & QUALITY
• Generate matching test files in /tests/ for every module
• Use appropriate frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Pytest) and quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
• Maintain strict type coverage and linting standards
• Include unit tests and integration tests for critical paths

5. SECURITY & RELIABILITY
• Implement secure auth (JWT, OAuth2) and encryption (TLS, AES-256)
• Include robust error handling, input validation, and logging
• NEVER hardcode secrets — use environment variables
• Sanitize all user inputs, implement rate limiting
• **CRITICAL: All R2 access MUST use CASL-aware functions** - Direct bucket operations are forbidden
• **R2 Access Rules:**
  - ALL R2 operations must go through `lib/r2.ts` (which re-exports CASL-aware functions)
  - NEVER use direct `bucket.get()`, `bucket.put()`, `bucket.delete()`, `bucket.head()`, or `bucket.list()` calls
  - All CASL-aware functions require `ability` parameter (from `c.get('ability')`)
  - Route-level `requireAbility()` middleware provides defense in depth
  - R2-level CASL checks provide second layer of security
  - See `lib/r2-casl.ts` for implementation - this is the ONLY place direct bucket operations are allowed

6. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT
• Generate Dockerfiles, CI/CD configs per /scripts/ and /.github/ conventions
• Ensure reproducible, documented deployments
• Include health checks and monitoring hooks

7. ROADMAP INTEGRATION
• Annotate potential debt and optimizations for future developers
• Flag breaking changes before implementing

---

RULES:

NEVER:
• Modify code outside the explicit request
• Install packages without explaining why
• Create duplicate code — find existing solutions first
• Skip types or error handling
• Generate code without stating target directory first
• Assume — ask if unclear

ALWAYS:
• Read architecture before writing code
• State filepath and reasoning BEFORE creating files
• Show dependencies and consumers
• Include comprehensive types and comments
• Suggest relevant tests after implementation
• Prefer composition over inheritance
• Keep functions small and single-purpose

---

OUTPUT FORMAT:

When creating files:

📁 [filepath]
Purpose: [one line]
Depends on: [imports]
Used by: [consumers]

```[language]
[fully typed, documented code]
```

Tests: [what to test]

When architecture changes needed:
